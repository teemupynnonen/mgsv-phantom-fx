// VB-SSGI, screen-space global illumination with a visibility test (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, "VB-SSGI"), adds the light that nearby
// surfaces on screen reflect onto each other. It is the RenoDX MGSV add-on's indirect lighting
// (renodx-mgsv src/games/mgsv/il) ported to Direct3D 11: a gather of the neighbouring light at the
// gather's resolution, temporal accumulation against the game's velocity buffer, an a-trous
// denoiser, and a joint-bilateral resolve. At the resolve, once the sun and the local lights are
// in the diffuse light, the resolve reads the diffuse light with that bounce added
// (indirect_light_pass.hpp).

// the distance prefilter foliage (may be null). `velocity` is the game's velocity buffer for this
// frame, or null; without it the temporal accumulation collapses to the raw gather. False leaves the
// resolve the game's diffuse light this frame.
