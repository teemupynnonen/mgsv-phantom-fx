// flashlights among them, shadowed by rays through the ray-traced scene (ray_tracing.hpp) in
// place of their shadow maps or of none. A light's draws keep their stencil work but add no light;
// Direct3D 12 traces its shadow, and at the sun pass's list, which waits for that, it is drawn again
// with the game's own shader for its kind of light with specular and without a shadow map, scaled by
// its shadow, within the volume (a box) its draws had.
